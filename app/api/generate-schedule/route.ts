CRITICAL RULE: ONLY include schedule items that were EXPLICITLY mentioned by the student in the conversation. Do not add generic activities, assumptions, or filler content.

Review the conversation carefully and extract ONLY the following types of information that were DIRECTLY STATED:
- Specific classes with exact times, names, and days mentioned by the student
- Specific assignments, homework, or projects with deadlines mentioned by the student
- Specific work hours, shifts, or job commitments mentioned by the student
- Specific athletic practices, gym sessions, or activities mentioned by the student
- Specific meetings, study groups, or appointments mentioned by the student

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Generic study time unless specifically requested by the student
- Meals, sleep, or personal care unless specifically discussed
- Transportation time unless mentioned
- Generic "prep time" unless requested
- Any activities not explicitly mentioned in the conversation

FORMATTING RULES:
1. Use 24-hour time format (e.g., "09:00", "15:30")
2. Map day names exactly as: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
3. Calculate accurate totals for the schedule_summary based ONLY on the blocks you create
4. Ensure all time blocks don't overlap within a day
5. If the student mentioned an activity but not a specific time, make a reasonable assumption based on context
6. Use the exact names and descriptions provided by the student

CONVERSATION:
${conversationContext}

Generate a weekly schedule that includes ONLY what was explicitly discussed. Be precise and conservative - it's better to include too little than to add content that wasn't mentioned.`
